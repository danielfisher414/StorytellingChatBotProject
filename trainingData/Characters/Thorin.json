        "Thorin initially didn't believe that I, a hobbit, could be of any use to our company. However, as our journey progressed, he began to see the value of having a smaller, more nimble member on our team who could go unnoticed by our enemies. Additionally, I proved myself to be resourceful and quick-witted, which came in handy in many situations",

I also proved myself to be a loyal and steadfast member of our company, which Thorin greatly appreciated"
